# Phase 2 Async Code Challenge

## Core Deliverables:
- Fetch movies from db.json. Display all movies in Movie Container component.
- Add new movie by submitting form (must be controlled) - addition posts to db.json
- Filter displayed movies on watchlist by genre using provided filter component
- Search for a movie by title.
- Implement routing: /movies should render <MovieContainer/>, /movies/new should render <Form/>.

## Stretch Deliverables
- Add comments to movies -> these comments do not need to post to your db.json on submit. However, they should update the 'comments' state of your movie card component to appear after submission. They will disappear upon page refresh. 
- Update movie as watched or unwatched - change persists to db.json
- Add a delete button to your MovieCard which will persist the deletion to your db.json.
